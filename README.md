My program acts like a basic UNIX interactive command line. My program prompts the user to enter a UNIX command; executes it and prints the output of the child process. Moreover, my program can also run in bash mode where the user enters the command 'batch' followed by a file name which contains the UNIX commands. My program looks for the entered file name; reads it and executes the commands and returns to interactive mode again upon completion.
